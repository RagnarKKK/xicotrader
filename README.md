Automatically trade cryoptocurrency, an academic example

The software consists of a automatic trading client, and a simulator that mocks
a data and order service.

An arbitration strategy is implemented to illustrate the automatic trading.
Upon each tick and current state, the strategy selects the best assets to cycle
from USD, BTC and ETH.

## Grab some data

The simulator understands the Poloniex API format and assumes a 5 min inter-tick period, e.g.,

```
https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&currencyPair=BTC_ETH&end=9999999999&period=300&start=1405699200
```

Under resources, create a directory called ```marketdata``` and place your
three market data files called ```btcusd.json```, ```ethbtc.json``` and 
```ethusd.json```.

Download the data from all three pairs and store them in files with the aforementioned names, e.g., 

```
curl https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&currencyPair=BTC_ETH&end=9999999999&period=300&start=1405699200 > ethbtc.json
curl https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&currencyPair=USDT_BTC&end=9999999999&period=300&start=1405699200 > btcusd.json
curl https://poloniex.com/public?command=returnChartData&currencyPair=USDT_ETH&end=9999999999&period=300&start=1405699200 > ethusd.json
```

## Usage

This is an example intended to use with a couple of REPLs.

```bash
lein with-profile simulator,dev repl
```


```bash
lein with-profile client,dev repl
```

Then issue ```(start)``` on each of the REPLs, starting with the simulator.

The simulator runs so that every 10 minutes is scaled down to 1 second, so you
can see things very quickly.

The simulator gets the first data not already in the past according to the simulator
time. So things are expected not to exactly align with a real situation.


### Use in real trading

The software is simple so the basic components should be robust. However the
software comes as is and the author offers no warranty.

For a real situation, a service that implements connectivity with your exchange 
can be implemented and added to the system dependencies in sustitution of the
component that implements connectivity with the simulator.
